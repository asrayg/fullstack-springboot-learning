# My Project

This project is a simple web application created for learning purposes. It uses Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and Postman for testing the API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Postman**: A collaboration platform for API development, which makes it easier to test and develop APIs.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Postman

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd my-project/backend
   ```
3. Build the Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
4. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Testing the API

Use Postman to test the API endpoints provided by the Spring Boot application. Import the Postman collection provided in the repository (if available) or manually create requests to test various endpoints.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you will learn how to:
- Set up and configure a Spring Boot application.
- Build a React frontend application.
- Integrate the frontend with the backend.
- Use Postman to test and debug API endpoints.
